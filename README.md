Responsive Menu
========================

Quick menu script thrown together for responsive websites.
Needed a way to open a dropdown on hover on desktop and then have a way to get to the 2nd level on mobile.

On mobile we change form hover to a stateful class called open.
If the item clicked on has children to show the class open is added to the parent, if cliked on again the parent link will open. If the ite, clicked does not have children the link will open as normal.
